# httpd-ack
## classic source code archive
**httpd-ack development stopped in 2008. A modern fork for current KallistiOS can be found as [httpd-ack next](https://github.com/darcagn/httpd-ack-next).**

`httpd-ack` is a classic Dreamcast disc dumping utility for use with the Broadband Adapter. This is a source code archive; although this software was not developed using git, each version in its history is represented as a commit here. This was compiled against a KallistiOS 1.x version from the 2000s, and will not compile against the latest KallistiOS. View `httpd-ack.txt` in each version for instructions for that specific version or `changelog.txt` to view the changes along the way.
